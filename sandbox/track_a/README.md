# Track A Sandbox

This sandbox is a learning and feasibility guide for the from-scratch LM track.
It is separate from the CS336 assignment repos and separate from the final
training path.

The question this sandbox answers is:

```text
Can we run the whole Track A loop end to end before real data and larger models?
```

The loop is:

```text
text corpus
→ tokenizer
→ token IDs
→ training batches
→ tiny causal language model
→ loss curve
→ sample generation
→ written interpretation
```

## Current Stage

The current runnable sandbox uses a character-level tokenizer. That is not the
final tokenizer. It is a safe first step because it lets the team understand the
full LM workflow before implementing and validating BPE.

## Why Character-Level First

Character-level tokenization is not the goal, but it is useful because:

- it avoids unapproved external data,
- it avoids pretending the BPE tokenizer is done,
- it makes encode/decode behavior easy to inspect,
- it lets us test the training loop with a tiny corpus,
- it gives the team a baseline before replacing it with BPE.

## Run

From the repo root:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_track_a_sandbox.py --max-steps 40
```

Outputs are written to:

```text
experiments/runs/track_a_sandbox/
```

That folder is local experiment output and should not be committed by default.

## Success Criteria For This Sandbox

The sandbox is successful if:

- the script runs from a fresh checkout,
- the tokenizer round-trips text with `decode(encode(text))`,
- training loss moves downward on the toy corpus,
- sample generation produces non-empty text,
- the summary file records config, losses, and sample output.

This does not mean the final Kinyarwanda LM is successful. It only means the
learning pipeline is wired together.

## Track A Gates

Track A can replace or reduce the need for Track B only if later stages pass
real gates:

1. Approved corpus exists.
2. BPE tokenizer is implemented and evaluated.
3. Tiny model trains reproducibly.
4. Validation loss improves on held-out Kinyarwanda text.
5. Samples are reviewed by fluent speakers.
6. The model can support learning tasks better than retrieval/prompting alone.

Until those gates pass, Track B remains a fallback for usefulness.

## Next Sandbox Stages

1. Add BPE tokenizer path.
2. Add an approved tiny corpus.
3. Compare char tokenizer vs BPE tokenizer.
4. Add validation split and perplexity report.
5. Add a short model-card style interpretation.
